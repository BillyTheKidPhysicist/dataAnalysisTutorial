A lab has built an amplifier for a laser and need quanitify some values to make sure everything is in spec
before installing it on their optics table. The amplifier has a few important characteristics. First, when 
the amplifier is powered on there is a certain amount of laser power always being generated, this is called
Amplified Sponteneous Emission. Second, the output laser power depends on the input laser power as an exponential
function. The function should be y=a*exp(b*x) where y is the output power, and x is the input power. Third, the amplifier
is sensitive to temperature, and to avoid overheating a temperature sensitive switch prevents any more electrical power
being applied to the amplifier after a certain temperature. Your goal is to determine the rate of background spontaneous
emission, the value of a and b, where this cuttoff occurs in terms of input laser power, and generate a publication quality graph of 
your results. Data is provided in a text file. The first column is the laser power sent into the amplifier in unit of microwatts
and the second column is the output power in units of watts. You will try to find the above values using a curve fit 
(scipy.optimize.curve_fit is your best choice) and show this fit on the graph over the data. The graph should also
have the values you found, as well as there uncertainty.. They can be in the title or on the graph itself. 
You don't need to use curve fitting neccesarily.
