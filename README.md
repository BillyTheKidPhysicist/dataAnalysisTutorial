Quick tutorial on data analysis for my students


I will give a quick rundown on why everyone should use python and answer some questions.

Why use python as a physicist???

First, python is very popular and many other physicists use it. It is very easy to find libraries that work in python for a huge variety of tasks including hardware control

Second, the alternatives kind of suck. Controlling hardware with LabView is awful. Image that you didn't know how to read, so you could only listen to things to learn. Well that would get you pretty far, but obviously knowing how to read is a far superior way to learn. 

Python is knowing how to read, LabView is not knowing how to read. It's easier to get started with LabView, but it quickly become horrible because of compatibility issues, you are programming in 2D, and there are not good standards on how to write and comment it.
I'm not a LabView expert, but that is my understanding.
